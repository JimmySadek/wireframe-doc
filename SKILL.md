description: Author and ship low-fidelity product wireframes as a single deployable HTML file from a Markdown spec — ASCII frames inside thin device-frame chrome, Mermaid flow diagrams, sticky-note style reviewer notes, and a Netflix-style horizontal canvas with tap-to-enlarge modal. Designed for asynchronous founder/team review BEFORE committing to UI design or Figma. Use this skill whenever the user wants to wireframe, mockup, sketch screens, or share screen flows for review — including phrases like "build me wireframes", "share screens with my cofounders", "low-fi mockup", "wireframe deck", "screen flow before we build it", "X frames for the [feature]", "cheap alternative to Figma", or "show my team the screens I have in mind". Trigger even when the user doesn't say the word "wireframe" explicitly — sketching screens, scaffolding a user flow, sharing frames with notes for async team review, and replacing heavy Figma exports with lightweight shareable URLs are all core use cases. Bundle scales with frame count — ~50 KB small to ~215 KB for a large multi-flow deck (still far smaller than a 1–2 MB Figma export).

# wireframe-doc

## What this skill does

The wireframe-doc skill lets you write product wireframes in plain Markdown and render them as a single deployable HTML file — no design tools, no Figma account, no multi-megabyte exports.

You write structured Markdown: ASCII frames that show what each screen looks like, a Mermaid flowchart that shows how screens connect, and bullet-note "sticky notes" that explain what's happening and what questions need answers. The render script assembles these into a polished review doc with a horizontal card strip, collapsible context sections, and a tap-to-enlarge modal for each frame.

The result is a shareable URL that works in any browser. Founders and teammates can view the flow, read the notes, and give targeted feedback by linking to specific frames via `#frame-{key}` anchors — no Figma view access, no Loom, no synchronous meeting required.

HTML in reviewer notes is sanitized by DOMPurify before rendering, so agent-generated content is safe to inject. CDN fallback shows raw source after 2 seconds if libraries fail to load.

## When to use it

- **Pre-design product reviews** — founders need to see flow and intent before committing to a UI implementation. ASCII frames communicate structure without burning design time.
- **Async team feedback on multi-flow user journeys** — share a URL, collect comments in a chat thread. No realtime coordination needed.
- **Lightweight specs that double as input to next-stage UI generation** — structured frame notes and scene descriptions are clean input for a UI-generation agent.
- **Replacing screenshot-heavy wireframe decks** — a 1–2 MB Figma export becomes a ~50–215 KB self-contained HTML. Faster to share, faster to load, version-controllable as plain text.

## When NOT to use it

- **Pixel-perfect mockups** — use a real design tool (Figma, Sketch, etc.). This is intentionally low-fidelity.
- **Interactive prototypes** — the output is static HTML. No clickable flows, no state transitions.
- **Brand-styled comps** — the template uses a neutral gray palette by design. It communicates intent, not aesthetics.

## Quick start

1. Copy `assets/spec-template.md` to your project:
   ```
   cp ~/.claude/skills/wireframe-doc/assets/spec-template.md my-wireframes/spec.md
   ```
2. Fill in the YAML frontmatter (`title`, `version`, `date`, `frame_count`, `deploy_url`), then write your scene, open questions, flow diagram, and frames.
3. Render:
   ```
   node ~/.claude/skills/wireframe-doc/scripts/wireframe-render.mjs my-wireframes/spec.md my-wireframes/index.html
   ```
4. Open `my-wireframes/index.html` in a browser, or deploy to any static host (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, S3, file://).
5. Share the URL. Link to specific frames via `#frame-{key}` (e.g., `your-url.com#frame-landing`).

## Spec syntax cheatsheet

| Syntax | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `## {Flow name}` | Defines a flow section (e.g., `## Onboarding flow`) |
| `### Frame: {Name}` | Defines a frame within the current flow |
| `key: {kebab-key}` | Frame key — REQUIRED, on the line right after `### Frame:`. Used as Mermaid node IDs and URL anchors (`#frame-{key}`). Must be lowercase kebab-case, unique per doc. |
| `device: {value}` | Per-frame device override — OPTIONAL, placed after `key:` and before the scene paragraph. Values: `phone` / `tablet` / `desktop` / `custom WxH` (e.g., `custom 1440x900`). |
| Paragraph after `### Frame:` line | Optional scene/flavor text (after `key:` and `device:` lines) |
| ` ```ascii ` block | Screen *contents* (monospace, whitespace preserved). The device frame is the screen border — **don't draw an outer box**; internal panels/tables are fine. Emoji ≈ 2 columns. |
| `**Notes:**` + content | Reviewer notes — full Markdown supported (bullets, paragraphs, headings, code, blockquotes) |
| ` ```mermaid ` block under `## Stream → screens` | Flow diagram. Use frame keys as node IDs — renderer substitutes frame headings as labels. Omit to auto-generate a linear graph. |

**YAML frontmatter fields:**
- `title` — page title + header h1
- `version` — shown in header (e.g., `v0`, `v1`)
- `date` — ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `frame_count` — total frame count (validated against actual count — error on mismatch; use `--lenient` to warn)
- `deploy_url` — URL without `https://` (shown in header + footer)
- `default_device` — OPTIONAL. Default device for all frames. Values: `phone` (default) / `tablet` / `desktop` / `custom WxH`.

**Device dimensions** (recognizable 1× logical viewports; height is a screen-shape floor — a longer screen still grows):
- `phone` → 390 × 844 (iPhone 14/15) — **default**
- `tablet` → 768 × 1024 (iPad portrait)
- `desktop` → 1280 × 800 (laptop, 16:10)
- `custom WxH` → W × H (e.g., `custom 1440x900`)

Each rendered frame is a **screen with a bezel** (2px border, device corners, a status strip on phone/tablet, a browser-chrome bar on desktop/custom). The screen is the chrome — **you don't draw an outer box**, just the screen contents. Content is clipped at the bezel like a real screen.

**ASCII sizing — FILL THE SCREEN (the #1 quality rule):**
The device frame is a real screen, not a sticky note. Author enough content to **fill it** — a header/title row, the body, actions, and often a bottom bar. A few short lines floating in a big empty screen looks broken, not low-fi. Match **both** the column and row target for the device:

| Device | Columns | Rows | Renders at |
|--------|---------|------|------------|
| `phone` (390×844) | **≈ 34–44** | **≈ 36–44** | ~13–17px |
| `tablet` (768×1024) | **≈ 70–95** | **≈ 44–56** | ~12–17px |
| `desktop` (1280×800) | **≈ 95–125** | **≈ 28–34** | ~16–21px |
| `custom WxH` | **≈ W ÷ 10** | **≈ H ÷ 22** | ~16px |

The renderer scales the font so the widest line fills the width and the rows fill the height — authoring to both targets is what makes a frame read like a real screen. Keep every line the same display width so internal panels align. **Emoji are welcome as icons** — counted as 2 columns, so budget 2 cells each. A genuinely sparse screen (a one-line confirmation) is fine; the *default* is a populated screen. Art far narrower than target renders chunky; far wider is clamped (min 7px) and clipped at the bezel.

**CLI flags:**
- `--lenient` — warn instead of error for `frame_count` mismatches and invalid `device:` values

## Authoring great wireframes (craft system)

This section teaches you, the authoring agent, how to produce top-tier wireframes with this skill. The screen and the notes are two different channels — use each for what it's good at:

> **Screen** (the ` ```ascii ` block) = pure ASCII + emoji. Rendered verbatim in monospace — **Markdown does NOT render here.** `##`, `**`, `` ``` `` are literal clutter; use ASCII/emoji hierarchy instead.
> **Notes / scene** = rich Markdown. Rendered to real HTML beside the screen. This is where bold, blockquote, code, and checklists pay off — use them.

### 1. Compose like a real screen

Every screen has a **top** (title / nav / actions), a **body** (the real content), and usually a **bottom** (tab nav / status / primary action). Don't float a few lines in the middle — fill it to the column **and** row target (see § ASCII sizing). Density by device: `phone` = one focused task + one primary action; `tablet` = one rich view; `desktop`/`custom` = dense, multi-panel (tables, KPI cards, side rails).

Hierarchy in **pure ASCII** (never `##`/`**` — they won't render):
- **Title / section:** a short label then a full-width rule, or an `UPPERCASE` label.
- **Emphasis:** a leading `▸`, an emoji icon, `[ ]`/`(•)`, `UPPERCASE`, or a box — not `**bold**`.
- **Grouping:** box-drawing panels `┌─ Title ─┐ … └─────────┘`.
- **Rules:** `────────` section · `════════` strong · `· · · · ·` soft.

### 2. ASCII component vocabulary (copy-paste)

| Component | Pattern |
|---|---|
| Top bar | `‹ Back     Title                       ⚙` |
| Bottom nav | rule, then `🏠 Home   🔍 Search   🔔 Alerts   👤 Me` |
| Button | `[ Primary ]`  `[ Cancel ]`  `[ + New ]` |
| Text input | `┌──────────────┐` / `│ value        │` / `└──────────────┘` |
| Search | `🔍 [ Search…                    ]` |
| Select / dropdown | `[ Option ▾ ]` |
| Checkbox | `[x] selected`   `[ ] not selected` |
| Radio | `(•) chosen`   `( ) other` |
| Toggle | `[x] on`  /  `[ ] off` |
| Tabs | `[ Active ]  Inactive   Inactive` |
| Card / panel | `┌ Title ──────────┐` … `└──────────────────┘` |
| Table | `┌ Col ─┬ Col ─┐` / `│ … │ … │` / `└──────┴──────┘` |
| List row | `• Label ───────────────────── meta` |
| Progress | `███████░░░  70%` |
| Bar chart | `Rosa L.  ████████████████  142` |
| Sparkline | `▁▂▄▅▆▇█   ▆▇█▅▆` |
| Badge / pill | `[ High ]`   `‹NEW›`   `( 3 )` |
| Avatar | `👤`  or  `( A )` |
| Empty state | a short centered line + one `[ CTA ]` |
| Loading | `▒▒▒▒▒▒    ▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒` |
| Active/selected row | prefix `▸ ` or wrap in a `═` border |

### 3. Curated emoji set (icons — 2 columns each)

Pick from this neutral, widely-rendered set; keep one consistent set per doc. An emoji must **clarify** (a nav target, a status, an action) — never decorate.

- **Navigation:** ◀ ▶ 🔼 🔽 ‹ › ☰ 🔍 🏠 ⚙️ 🔔 👤 ✕ ⤴
- **Status:** 🟢 🟡 🔴 ✅ ⚠️ ⏳ 🔄 ⛔ ℹ️ ★ ☆
- **Objects / sections:** 📂 📊 📈 📉 📋 📝 📨 📥 📤 🗂 👥 🔗 💳 🗓️ 🔒 🏷️
- **Actions:** ➕ ✏️ 🗑️ 💾 ⬇️ ⬆️ 🔁 ▶️ ⏸️

The renderer counts each emoji as 2 monospace cells, so budget 2 cells and alignment + auto-fit stay correct.

### 4. Legend block

For any non-obvious symbol set, add a 2–3 line legend in the screen or the scene so the wireframe reads independently — e.g. `legend:  · 0–3   ░ 4–8   ▒ 9–14   █ 15+`.

### 5. Notes & scene — your rendered-Markdown channel

For **every** frame, exploit rendered Markdown in the notes:
- `**bold**` the decision or the critical constraint.
- `>` blockquote the one open question the frame raises.
- `` `code` `` for fields / endpoints / keys (`GET /tickets`, `frame_count`).
- `- [ ]` / `- [x]` acceptance criteria; numbered lists for ordered steps; nested lists for decision trees.
- `_italic_` for asides. The screen shows *what*; the notes argue *why / open questions / backend* — in rich text.

### 6. Anti-patterns — do not ship these

- A few short lines marooned in a big screen (sparse — fill it).
- An outer `┌──┐ … └──┘` box around the whole frame (the bezel **is** the screen).
- `##`, `**`, or `` ``` `` **inside the screen** — literal noise; use ASCII/emoji hierarchy.
- Misaligned columns / inconsistent line widths.
- Placeholder lorem or `[text here]` — use realistic labels, counts, and states.
- Emoji as decoration, or a different emoji for the same concept across frames.
- Borders everywhere with no visual hierarchy.

## Examples

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `examples/minimal/poc.md` | Smallest valid 2-frame spec (note-taking app onboarding). Good starting point. |
| `examples/multi-flow/poc.md` | 5-frame spec with 2 flows, two desktop frames, multi-paragraph notes. Shows the full feature set. |
| `examples/dashboard/poc.md` | 6-frame **desktop** example (support-ticket queue console). Dense tables, KPI cards, ASCII charts, one `custom 1440x900` frame — the ASCII-fit showcase. |
| `examples/stress-test/poc.md` | Real-world-scale stress test. Mermaid with subgraphs, rich notes, edge cases. |

Render any example:
```
node ~/.claude/skills/wireframe-doc/scripts/wireframe-render.mjs \
  ~/.claude/skills/wireframe-doc/examples/minimal/poc.md \
  /tmp/test-minimal.html && open /tmp/test-minimal.html
```

## Tests

Seven fixture files in `tests/fixtures/` cover all blocker and important-fix verifications. Run them manually:

```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/wireframe-doc
for f in tests/fixtures/*.md; do
  echo "=== $f ==="
  node scripts/wireframe-render.mjs "$f" /tmp/test-out.html 2>&1
  echo "exit: $?"
  echo ""
done
```

See `tests/fixtures/EXPECTED.md` for expected behavior per fixture.
